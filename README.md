# Welcome to the Pokemon API UI!

I selected the Modal UI, so every time you click on a pokemon's name a window will pop up on the page with more information about them and a photo.

Some of the features that I wish to implement in the future would be making it look prettier. This was a pretty short turn around for a project so I wish I had more time to mess around with it, but we reached MVP and that's what matters!

Languages/skills used:

React.js, Javascript, fetch API calls, axios, CSS
